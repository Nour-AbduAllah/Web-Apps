Online shop is an E-Commerce website that selling electronic devices.
What I have practiced and learned from this Project:
	-Designed some pages(views) to take and present data from and to the user, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Razor.
	-Used user friendly icons and some alerts to make the view more beautiful, using Fontawesome and Allertfy.js libraryies.
	-Controlled pages access permission levels to protect private pages of admins using role-based authorization.
